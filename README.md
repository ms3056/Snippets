# Snippet Collection

- These snippets are made for my personal use. I will not be taking requests to change them. If you find a bug I may fix it, but there are no guarantees.

## Issues

- The `Horizontal.csss` snippet does not work on iOS or iPad. 
- The `Tasks.css` snippet is very specific for me and how I use tasks in Obsidian
- These snippets look best in Dark Mode. `Acent.css` anf `Cards.css` work good in Light Mode but not all of the snippets look nice in Light Mode. I will slowly fix the snippets to look nicer in Light Mode but since I don't use it my priority is low. 


## Attribution

- The `Cards.css` snippet is mostly NOT MY OWN WORK. It was taken from the excellent AnuPpuccin theme. I have made significant changes, but the baseline was all of their work. Please visit their theme page: [AnuPpuccin GitHub](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin) and please consider [Buying them a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anubisnekhet).

- I have also had a lot of help from the Discord community - FireIsGood, sailKite, Daniel NL and others. If you feel I have left you out of the attribution let me know and I will add you. I have not purposly included anyone's code, but if you believe I have, please let me know and I will either remove it or attribute you immedaitely. 

### Weather Icons

- The icons for the Tenki app in the snippet `Tenki.css` come from the following repository:

> Meteocons
> Source: https://github.com/basmilius/weather-icons
> MIT License - (c) 2020-2022 Bas Milius

- Not all of the icons have been replaced - I will be replacing them as I see new weather conditions pop up. 

## Usage

- Select the `Default Theme`
- The minimum snippets you need to activate are `Accent.css` and `Cards.css`. All others are optional.
- You will also need the `Style Settings` plugin in order to change the accent colors.
